## Introduction
The command I will be looking at is 'find'. Its general use is:
`$ find [path] [expression]`
where \[path] is the starting directory and \[expression] is a set of options that specify the criteria for finding files. This report will examine the following options: -name, -type, -size, and -exec.

## -name option
1. search for all text files
2. search for a specific word

## -type option
1. search for a file
2. search for a directory

## -size option
1. search for >100 kB files
2. search for <5 kB files

## -exec option
1. grep/search for a word
2. rm/remove all small files
