# Remote Access Tutorial

Signing in to the *@ieng6* servers remotely is a tricky process involving password changes and seemingly complex terminal commands.
However, following these steps will make the process much easier.

## I. Your Remote Account
In order to login to the server, you first need the class-specifice credentials for your account, which can found [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) after entering your username and PID.

This is your account username; you must also change the password with the link on screen ([also here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/password.php)). Make sure to select "No" for "Change MyTritonLink password?" and "Yes" for "Change course-specific account passwords?"

>Note 1: Here are the password requirements
> * 12-30 characters
> * Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
> * Do not use any part of your name or username.
> * Do not use alphabet, number, or keyboard sequences.

>Note 2: I've previously had trouble logging in with my password if the special character is an asterisk (\*), so try to use some other character like @ or !
