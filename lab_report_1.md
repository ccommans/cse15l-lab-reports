# Remote Access Tutorial

Signing in to the *@ieng6* servers remotely is a tricky process involving password changes and seemingly complex terminal commands.
However, following these steps will make the process much easier.

## I. Your Remote Account
In order to login to the server, you first need the class-specifice credentials for your account, which can found [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) after entering your username and PID.

This is your account username; you must also change the password with the link on screen ([also here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/password.php)). Make sure to select "No" for "Change MyTritonLink password?" and "Yes" for "Change course-specific account passwords?"

>Note: I've previously had trouble logging in with my password if the special character is an asterisk (\*), so try to use some other character like @ or !
